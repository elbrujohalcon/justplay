# justplay

Sounds at the ease of hand

## Purpose

This is a simple wrapper to reproduce sounds easily in Android Apps.
It accepts multiple sources:
* _RAW_: Local stored raw files
* _URI_ : URI pointing to audio files, regardless of their origin.
* _URL_ : Directly stream a audio file and play it.

> Currently, the library JUSTPLAYS the sound.
>   1. If you try to play the same sound repeatedly or different files toghether it will work as expected.
>   2. It initiates a new task per sound.
